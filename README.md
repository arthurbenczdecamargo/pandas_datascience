# Pandas data science
**Data science using *Jupyter Notebook* and *Pandas* library.**

## Overview
This project utilizes *Jupyter Notebook* and *Anaconda* to analyze and interpret data and then create graphs. The program loads the data related to residential and commercial properties as a *Pandas DataFrame*. Additionally, it filters the data to focus on specific apartments through queries and generates new columns for monthly price, annual price and description.

## Features

• Creates graphs to show the residential properties prices;<br>
• Generates new information on the *DataFrame*;<br>
• Saves the data related to apartments in a CSV file.
